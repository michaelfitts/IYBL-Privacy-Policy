# IYBL Privacy Policy  
_Last Updated: October 2025_

## Introduction
The **Idaho Youth Basketball League** (“IYBL,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) values your privacy.  
This Privacy Policy explains how the **IYBL mobile application** (“App”) handles information.

In short — **we do not collect, sell, or track personal data.**  
The App is a simple tool for players, parents, and coaches to view schedules, scores, and team information managed by the league.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Regular Users
- The App does **not** require user accounts or logins.  
- We do **not** collect or store any personal information on our servers.  
- Any preferences (such as followed teams or notification settings) are stored **locally on your device** and are never sent to IYBL.

### Administrators
- Only authorized **league administrators** can sign in to manage schedules, rosters, and scores.  
- Administrative access is secured and limited to internal league staff.

### Automatically Collected Technical Information
To keep the App functioning correctly, it may temporarily access minimal technical data such as:
- Device type and operating system (for compatibility)
- App version
- Basic performance or crash logs (to fix bugs)

This data is **anonymous** and used only to maintain and improve App performance.

---

## 2. How We Use Information
We use limited technical or administrative data solely to:
- Display schedules, standings, and results
- Send optional notifications (if enabled)
- Maintain App reliability and security
- Allow league administrators to update information

We do **not** use any data for advertising, marketing, or profiling.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security
- All network communication uses **HTTPS/TLS encryption**.  
- Administrative data (e.g., scores or rosters) is securely stored in **Supabase**, our backend provider.  
- User preferences remain stored **only on your device**.  
- We do not maintain or process personal data on IYBL servers.

---

## 4. Data Sharing
We **do not**:
- Sell or rent any user information  
- Share data with advertisers or analytics platforms  

We may disclose limited data only if:
- Required by law, or  
- Necessary to protect the rights or safety of users or the league.

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy
The IYBL App may be used by players of all ages, including children.  
Because the App does **not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from any user**, there is **no special handling required for children’s data**.  
All data displayed in the App (such as rosters and schedules) is provided directly by the league and does not include private or identifying information beyond what is already publicly available in normal league operations.

---

## 6. Your Choices
- You can disable or re-enable notifications at any time through your device settings.  
- You can delete the App at any time to remove all locally stored data.  
- Because no accounts or personal data exist, there are no server records to access or delete.

---

## 7. Third-Party Services
The App relies on a few trusted third-party services for core functionality:

- **Supabase** – secure database hosting for league data  
  [https://supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy)  
- **Expo** – mobile framework for building and maintaining the App  
  [https://expo.dev/privacy](https://expo.dev/privacy)

Both providers follow industry-standard security and privacy practices.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as technology or league operations evolve.  
Any major updates will be announced in the App or on the league website.
