# Privacy Policy for IYBL App

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Introduction

The Idaho Youth Basketball League (“**IYBL**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) values your privacy.  
This Privacy Policy explains how the IYBL mobile application (“**App**”) handles information.  
In short — we don’t collect or sell personal data. The App is designed for local use by players, parents, and coaches to view schedules, scores, and team information.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Regular Users
We do **not** require account creation, and we do **not** collect or store personal information on our servers.  
All user preferences (such as followed teams or notification settings) are stored **locally on your device** and never transmitted to IYBL.

### Administrators
Only authorized league administrators can sign in to update schedules, scores, and team information.  
Administrative access is secured and limited to internal league staff.

### Automatically Collected Technical Information
The App may temporarily access limited technical details to ensure proper functionality, such as:
- Device type and operating system (for compatibility)
- App version
- Basic performance or crash logs (to help us fix bugs)

This information is **not linked to your identity** and is used only to maintain and improve the App.

---

## 2. How We Use Information

We use limited technical and administrative data solely to:
- Display current schedules, standings, and results  
- Deliver optional notifications (if enabled)  
- Maintain and improve App performance and reliability  
- Securely update information entered by league administrators  

We do **not** use any information for advertising, profiling, or marketing.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- All network communication uses **HTTPS/TLS encryption**.  
- Administrative data is stored securely using **Supabase**, our backend service provider.  
- Regular user data remains **stored locally** on your device.  
- We do not store or process personal data on our own servers.

---

## 4. Data Sharing

We do **not**:
- Sell or rent user information.  
- Share data with advertisers or third-party marketing platforms.

We may share limited data **only** when:
- Required by law or legal process, or  
- Necessary to protect the rights and safety of users or the league.

---

## 5. Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for general audiences and may be used by parents and players aged 13 and older.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  
If we become aware of any such data, it will be deleted immediately.

---

## 6. Your Choices

You can:
- Disable or re-enable push notifications at any time through your device settings.  
- Delete the App to remove all locally stored data.  

Because no personal data is collected, there is no user account or server record to access or delete.

---

## 7. Third-Party Services

The App relies on a few trusted tools strictly for functionality:

- **Supabase** – secure data hosting for league schedules and results  
  [https://supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy)
